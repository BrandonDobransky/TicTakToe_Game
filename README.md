# Roadmap to Future Improvements
1) Some improvements that I would make to this incldue some animations or alerts during game play and after all the spaces are taken. A winning message, a tie message, etc. I also think it would be cool to make an option to play a cpu opponent.
2) The next improvement I would make would be adding a reset button. A button that would let you restart or end the game before it is finished.
